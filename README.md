# Graph Cruncher

An experimental graph parsing, manipulation and transformation library based on
[Algebraic graphs](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs/docs/Algebra-Graph.html)

## Features

* Import undirected graphs from GraphML files
* Manipulate and transform polymorphic graph expressions with magnificent `Alga` library
* Generate VHDL descriptions of graph circuits

## Description

This code is meant to be an accompanying material for 'Embedding Graphs in Silicon' FDL'17 paper.

VHDL code generation is a port of a corresponding [pangraph](https://github.com/tuura/pangraph/tree/master/src/Pangraph/VHDL) module.
